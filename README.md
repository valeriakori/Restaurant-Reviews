# Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you experience exclusive dineries of New York City. 
Check out different cuisines, read reviews and plan your next meal according to the restaurants location and opening hours. It connects *accessibility*, *responsiveness* and *caching* for a mobile-ready and seamless offline web application.

### How do I open this project?

1. Clone this repo to your computer using following command
`git clone https://github.com/valeriakori/Restaurant-Reviews.git` 
in your terminal.

2. Setting the projectup in a live HTTP server using Python:
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

Alternatively you can use VS Code extensions like **Live Server**. Make sure to change `const port` at `dbhelper.js` on line 11 accordingly (e.g. 5500)
